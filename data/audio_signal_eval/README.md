# Audio Signal Eval

This package is a small staging area for future audio-behavior labeling.

It is not part of the frozen guidance benchmark, the active holdout benchmark,
or the watchlist-derived unseen holdout benchmark.

## Purpose

Use this package to build a small, auditable gold set for deterministic
audio-behavior signals such as:

- hesitation: `low | medium | high`
- pause_before_answer: `low | medium | high`
- filler_density: `low | medium | high`
- answer_onset_delay: `low | medium | high`
- interruption_overlap: `low | medium | high` if supportable later

## Scope

- source rows should come from repo-native earnings-call media where transcript
  timing and normalized audio both exist locally
- rows should be answer-level whenever possible
- labels should stay observational and timing-based
- do not infer emotion, deception, or hidden intent

## Files

- `source_manifest.csv`: candidate source calls with local transcript/audio paths
- `candidate_labels.csv`: header-only label file for future answer-level spans

## Current status

This package is scaffold-only for now. No audio gold labels have been appended.

Current `source_manifest.csv` rows still point to legacy-local normalized audio
cache files where those files have not yet been rehydrated in the canonical
checkout. Treat that manifest as staging guidance only, not as proof that the
audio assets are canonical-repo-local today.
