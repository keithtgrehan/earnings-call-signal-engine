# Earnings Call Signal Engine
Transcript-first deterministic review tool that turns one earnings call into structured, auditable artifacts and a local analyst-style review workspace.

This project is a local decision-support system for earnings-call review. It is not a live trading system, does not execute orders, and does not claim predictive edge or statistical significance.

Audio, NLP sidecars, and optional video summaries are supporting layers only. The transcript-backed deterministic artifacts remain the source of truth.

Fixed presentation/demo cases currently include Netflix Q1 2022, Meta Q3 2022, and NVIDIA Q4 FY24. The NVIDIA case was rebuilt from a local official transcript PDF and follows the same transcript-first deterministic pattern.

## Start Here
- [Demo UI / local review shell](#demo-ui)
- [Evidence map](docs/evidence-map.md)
- [End-to-end demo path](docs/demo-path.md)
- [Current status](docs/current-status.md)

## Why This Project Matters
Earnings calls combine explicit guidance, hedging, Q&A pressure, and delivery cues across transcript, audio, and optional video. This project keeps the workflow grounded in transcript-first deterministic artifacts so a reviewer can inspect evidence directly instead of relying on opaque summary claims.

## Demo UI
The main demo surface is a local review shell served by `app/site_server.py`. It is designed for analyst-style inspection, not production deployment.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src PORT=7872 python app/site_server.py
```

Current demo path:
- `Demo mode`: loads fixed Netflix Q1 2022, Meta Q3 2022, and NVIDIA Q4 FY24 cases instantly for a presentation-safe walkthrough
- `Input mode`: keeps the ordinary local workflow for YouTube, local media, transcript upload, and pasted transcript text
- `Raw source vs extracted signal`: the centerpiece view keeps source excerpts, extracted signals, ambiguity notes, and supporting context in one review workspace

Current demo status:
- transcript-first deterministic artifacts remain canonical
- multimodal layers stay secondary and supporting only
- the shell is positioned as a local review tool, not a hosted product or live trading system

## Project Summary
The repo converts one earnings call into structured, auditable artifacts that help a reviewer inspect:
- guidance statements and guidance-change evidence
- tone-change moments
- deterministic behavior signals such as uncertainty, reassurance, and analyst skepticism
- deterministic Q&A shift summaries
- deterministic audio behavior summaries for pause / hesitation review support
- optional observational visual-behavior summaries for video-capable runs
- deterministic scorecard presentation for reviewer-friendly ranking and triage
- transcript-backed supporting spans
- report and metrics outputs for local review

The current workflow is transcript-first and deterministic-first across audio, video, and text inputs. Optional narrative layers exist, but the deterministic artifacts remain the source of truth.

## What Is Implemented Now
- End-to-end CLI pipeline via `earnings-call-sentiment` for:
  - YouTube or local media ingestion
  - audio normalization
  - transcription
  - segment and chunk scoring
  - deterministic guidance extraction
  - deterministic guidance revision comparison
  - deterministic tone-change detection
  - deterministic behavior-signal extraction:
    - uncertainty / hedging
    - management reassurance
    - analyst skepticism
  - deterministic Q&A shift summary artifacts
  - deterministic audio behavior monitoring for answer-level pause / hesitation support:
    - pause-before-answer
    - answer-onset delay
    - filler density
    - lightweight hesitation summaries
  - optional visual behavior monitoring for video-capable runs:
    - frame sampling
    - face visibility / face presence analysis
    - motion and head-shift proxies
    - segment-level visual stability summaries
  - deterministic scorecard presentation layer that ranks current review evidence into reviewer-friendly categories
  - report, metrics, and artifact generation
- Primary local review UI shell served by `app/site_server.py`
- Benchmark subset shown in the UI and now sourced from canonical gold labels, not draft labels
- Frozen 9-call gold guidance benchmark under `data/gold_guidance_calls/`
- Gold benchmark summary utility:
  - `python scripts/summarize_gold_benchmark.py`

## Behavior Layer
Phase 1 behavioral monitoring is implemented with deterministic, auditable rules only:
- uncertainty / hedging
- management reassurance
- analyst skepticism / hostility

The behavior layer is observational. It is not emotion-truth inference, not deception detection, and not a claim about hidden intent.

Current measured result on the small internal behavior eval set:
- overall: `58/58`
- `uncertainty`: `20/20`
- `reassurance`: `20/20`
- `skepticism`: `18/18`

This is a deterministic rule-QA check on a small curated set, not a statistical validation set.

## Q&A Shift
The repo now includes a deterministic Q&A shift layer that summarizes:
- prepared remarks vs Q&A differences
- analyst question pressure context
- management answer uncertainty relative to the prepared baseline

Outputs include:
- `qa_shift_segments.csv`
- `qa_shift_summary.json`

## Audio Behavior
The repo now includes a deterministic audio behavior support layer for answer-level review. It is observational only and is meant to help reviewers inspect pauses and hesitation patterns around management answers.

Outputs include:
- `audio_behavior_segments.csv`
- `audio_behavior_summary.json`

This layer is not emotion inference, not lie detection, and not a truth detector.

## Review Scorecard
The repo now includes a deterministic scorecard presentation layer derived from existing guidance, behavior, and Q&A artifacts.

It adds:
- six reviewer-facing category scores on a `1-10` scale
- green / amber / red bands
- an overall review signal
- a review-confidence percentage
- short explanations and strongest evidence snippets

The scorecard is presentation-only. It does not replace raw artifacts, does not change benchmark labels, and does not add trading or alpha claims.

Review confidence means confidence in the tool's interpretation of the available deterministic evidence, not investment confidence.

## Current Review Layers
- guidance extraction and guidance revision comparison
- behavioral text signals: uncertainty, reassurance, analyst skepticism
- deterministic Q&A shift
- deterministic audio behavior support
- optional visual behavior support
- deterministic scorecard presentation layer

Audio and visual layers are supporting, quality-gated review aids. They are not truth detectors and should not be presented as hidden-state inference.

## Conservative Multimodal Status
The repo remains transcript-first. Multimodal artifacts are supporting context layers and do not replace the deterministic transcript-backed outputs.

Current committed multimodal summary outputs under `data/processed/multimodal/eval/` report:
- `12` source calls
- `5` source/layout groups
- `28` manifest segments
- `4` sources with visual sidecar artifacts
- `1` source with NLP sidecar artifacts
- `5` sources with any multimodal sidecar artifacts
- `0` sources with alignment artifacts
- `1` visually usable segment
- `0` audio-aligned segments
- `561` segments with NLP support

Reviewer quick check:
- Canonical review truth still lives in transcript-first deterministic outputs such as `transcript.json`, `transcript.txt`, `guidance.csv`, `guidance_revision.csv`, `tone_changes.csv`, and `report.md`.
- Curated sidecar execution status lives in `data/processed/multimodal/eval/curated_slice_run_status.json`.
- Clip-based visual runtime status lives in `data/processed/multimodal/visual/curated_clip_run_status.json`.
- Committed source-level visual summaries live under `data/processed/multimodal/visual/<source_id>/segment_visual_features.{csv,json}` and `visual_coverage_summary.json`.
- Rolled-up multimodal breadth lives in `data/processed/multimodal/eval/multimodal_eval_summary.json`.
- Four committed Codex prototype artifact-review rows live in `data/media_support_eval/multimodal_review_results_codex_proto.csv`, and their saved descriptive summary lives in `outputs/media_support_eval/multimodal_review_summary.json`.
- Those four rows are repo-artifact prototype reviews, not human-subject results, and they do not establish multimodal lift or statistical significance.
- The merged `main` branch keeps rolled-up multimodal status artifacts and committed source-level visual summaries; supporting sidecars do not replace transcript-backed review truth.

Built vs exercised vs unproven:
- Built:
  source-level visual summary artifacts, curated slice status reporting, clip runtime status artifacts, and multimodal eval summaries are present in the repo.
- Exercised:
  visual support has been exercised on a small curated 4-source slice, and the committed eval summary records supporting NLP coverage for 1 source.
- Not yet exercised in the current committed outputs:
  alignment coverage remains `0`, so the current repo state does not show committed WhisperX-aligned source artifacts.

Practical visual workflow:
- full-webcast OpenFace runs were impractical on local hardware
- the current practical path is short, manually chosen runtime-check clips from real local video
- those clip runs are then rolled up into source-level visual summary artifacts
- video support is therefore real, but still secondary to transcript evidence
- in the current committed slice, `1` clip window is usable and `3` completed windows are explicitly marked unusable because the face is too small or intermittent

## What This Does Not Prove
- no statistical significance
- no trading edge or alpha
- no validated predictive lift from multimodal sidecars
- no proof that clip-based visual summaries improve benchmark outcomes
- no proof that current visual outputs generalize to full-call or production-scale use
- no proof that alignment or diarization are working at meaningful scale in the current committed repo state

## Repo-Native Media Support Set
- committed media-support labels now cover 102 segments:
  - 84 audio
  - 18 video
- 9 of the 23 downstream comparison cases now carry source-level media-support targets
- visual tension still covers 12 labeled rows across 2 independent source groups, so the visual layer remains calibration-only and underpowered relative to the transcript/audio path

## Current Review Outputs
Artifacts currently produced by the core pipeline include:
- The canonical review path remains transcript-first and deterministic. Optional audio, NLP, and video sidecars should be read as supporting context when present.
- `transcript.json`, `transcript.txt`
- `chunks_scored.jsonl`, `sentiment_segments.csv`
- `guidance.csv`, `guidance_revision.csv`, `tone_changes.csv`
- `uncertainty_signals.csv`, `reassurance_signals.csv`, `analyst_skepticism.csv`
- `behavioral_summary.json`, `qa_shift_segments.csv`, `qa_shift_summary.json`
- `audio_behavior_segments.csv`, `audio_behavior_summary.json` when audio support is available
- `visual_behavior_frames.csv`, `visual_behavior_segments.csv`, `visual_behavior_summary.json` for video-capable runs
- `metrics.json`, including a `review_scorecard` block with:
  - `overall_review_signal`
  - `review_confidence_pct`
  - ranked categories, scores, bands, explanations, and strongest evidence
- `report.md`, which surfaces the scorecard alongside the raw deterministic summaries
- `run_meta.json`

Optional heuristic outputs still exist, but they are not the current benchmark focus:
- question-shift artifacts
- optional summary/eval utilities
- offline backtest scripts

## UI / Local Review Shell
The active local review shell is the primary interface served by:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src PORT=7872 python app/site_server.py
```

Current shell structure:
- hero framing and review-surface selection
- `Demo mode` for fixed Netflix / Meta presentation cases
- `Input mode` for real YouTube, media, and transcript review
- centerpiece evidence workspace for `Raw source vs extracted signal`
- supporting panels for management caution, audio support, market context, artifacts, and recent local runs

This is a local review product shell for analyst-style inspection. It is not a production SaaS app, and it should be presented as local decision support only.

## Gold Benchmark
The frozen gold benchmark lives under:

```text
data/gold_guidance_calls/
```

Frozen scope:
- `call01`
- `call02`
- `call03`
- `call04`
- `call05`
- `call06`
- `call07`
- `call08`
- `call09`

Canonical files:
- `data/gold_guidance_calls/labels.csv`
- `data/gold_guidance_calls/call_manifest.csv`

`labels.csv` is now the canonical source of truth for benchmark labels.

The UI benchmark subset reads from canonical gold `labels.csv` and uses manifest data only for supporting display metadata such as source URL, quality flag, and notes.

Current frozen gold label distribution:
- `raised`: 1
- `maintained`: 1
- `lowered`: 1
- `withdrawn`: 0
- `unclear`: 6

This benchmark is intentionally conservative. If a transcript contains explicit forward guidance but no explicit direction change versus prior guidance, the gold label stays `unclear`.

## Evaluation Evidence
- Frozen benchmark agreement on canonical gold labels: `9/9`
- Active unseen holdout agreement on current labeled rows: `7/7`
- Watchlist-derived unseen holdout agreement on current labeled rows: `7/7`
- Behavior mini-eval agreement on current labeled rows: `58/58`
- Prototype multimodal review evidence currently includes `4` committed Codex artifact-review rows plus a saved descriptive summary; treat them as process and traceability evidence only, not as human-study validation.

These are benchmark-agreement and rule-QA results only. They do not establish predictive edge, statistical significance, or finance-specific generalization.

## Benchmark And Package Layout
The repo now contains six distinct benchmark or benchmark-adjacent data areas:

- `data/gold_guidance_calls/`
  - canonical frozen guidance-change benchmark
  - active source of truth for the `9/9` frozen evaluation result
- `data/gold_guidance_calls_holdout/`
  - active unseen holdout benchmark
  - separate from the frozen benchmark and used for current unseen agreement checks
- `data/gold_guidance_calls_holdout_watchlist/`
  - second unseen holdout built from watchlist-derived candidate rows
  - current agreement checkpoint: `7/7`
  - separate from both the frozen benchmark and the original active holdout
- `data/watchlist_earnings_candidates/`
  - metadata-first future candidate pool sourced from the supplied watchlist
  - not an active benchmark and not a canonical label source
  - may include official-source excerpts where full transcript collection was blocked
- `data/nvda_2025_historical_calls/`
  - separate NVIDIA calendar-year 2025 call-history pack
  - preserves NVIDIA's official fiscal-quarter labels for the four earnings calls that occurred during calendar year 2025
  - not part of the frozen benchmark or active holdout benchmark
- `data/behavior_signal_eval/`
  - small internal evaluation set for the behavior layer
  - separate from the guidance-change benchmarks
  - used to measure uncertainty, reassurance, and skepticism rules

## Utility Scripts
### Gold benchmark summary
Run:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_gold_benchmark.py
```

It prints:
- total benchmark row count
- label distribution
- one compact per-call table with:
  - `call_id`
  - `ticker`
  - `company`
  - `quarter`
  - `event_date`
  - `guidance_change_label`

It exits nonzero if:
- `labels.csv` is missing
- duplicate `call_id` rows exist
- any label falls outside:
  - `raised`
  - `maintained`
  - `lowered`
  - `withdrawn`
  - `unclear`

### Benchmark evaluator
Run:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_gold_benchmark.py
python scripts/evaluate_gold_benchmark.py --benchmark-root data/gold_guidance_calls_holdout --output-dir outputs/holdout_eval --benchmark-name "Expanded Holdout Benchmark Evaluation"
python scripts/evaluate_gold_benchmark.py --benchmark-root data/gold_guidance_calls_holdout_watchlist --output-dir outputs/holdout_watchlist_eval --benchmark-name "Watchlist Holdout Benchmark Evaluation"
```

Useful companion docs:
- `docs/evaluation-baseline.md`
- `docs/capstone-evaluation-summary.md`
- `data/watchlist_earnings_candidates/README.md`
- `data/nvda_2025_historical_calls/README.md`

### Behavior mini-eval
Run:

```bash
python scripts/summarize_behavior_eval_set.py
python scripts/evaluate_behavior_signal_set.py
```

## What Remains Unproven
- No proven predictive edge
- No statistical significance claim
- No live trading claim
- No claim that the current deterministic rule set is validated beyond the current frozen benchmark and local review workflow
- No emotion-truth, intent, or deception claim from the behavior layer

The current baseline is useful for structured review, but it still needs broader unseen evaluation before stronger claims are justified.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Add more defensible unseen holdout rows, especially `lowered` cases
- Keep rerunning frozen, active holdout, and watchlist-holdout evaluation as new unseen rows are added
- Keep the benchmark package separate from any predictive or backtest claims
- Keep multimodal visual monitoring observational and optional rather than changing the transcript-first baseline

```

## Limitations
- Deterministic artifacts remain the source of truth
- The guidance benchmark is still small, and both unseen sets remain limited and excerpt-heavy
- The behavior eval set is small and internal; it is useful for rule QA, not for broad claims
- Behavior outputs are observational review aids, not emotion/deception inference
- Visual behavior outputs are low-confidence under poor framing, low face visibility, or sparse usable frames
- Any predictive or trading-performance claims require separate out-of-sample evaluation work

## Notes On Scope
- The frozen guidance benchmark is fixed at 9 calls for the current core evaluation pass
- Draft benchmark files still exist for review history, but they are no longer the canonical label source
- Candidate and history packages are separate from benchmark packages and should not be treated as active gold sets
